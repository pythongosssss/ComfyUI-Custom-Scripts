# ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts.git`  
to your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory

   The script will then automatically install all custom scripts and nodes.  
   It will attempt to use symlinks and junctions to prevent having to copy files and keep them up to date.

- For uninstallation:
  - Delete the cloned repo in `custom_nodes`
  - Ensure `web/extensions/pysssss/CustomScripts` has also been removed

# Update
1. Navigate to the cloned repo e.g. `custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts`
2. `git pull`
